# nucs.matrix.lab
My HomeLab running on NUCs #sustainability

## Purpose
As a #sustainability goal, I decided to spin down my infrequently used #homelab.  The old homelab consisted of 3 x ESXi nodes (20 cores, 128GB) and a freeNAS array (4 x SSD, 3 HDD).  
This ![Image](Images/saving_the_world.png) shows the power reduction when I turned down the last 1 Hypervisor and the storage host.
